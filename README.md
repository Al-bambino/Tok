# Tok
Tok is python-like programming language that I created for Compilers course on School of Computing.

Tok is compiled on python code and currently supports **if** and **dont_f_stop_until** loops.

In the examples folder you can find some hm well ... examples. if you'd like to compile your own .tok files use terminal 
> python compiler.py ./examples/test1/1.tok > ./examples/test1.py


Here is how pretty can it be, after writing your own sublime script for colloring:
